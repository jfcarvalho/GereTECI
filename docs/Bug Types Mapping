Bug Types Mapping

Problem:
"Exception evaluating SpringEL expression: "#fields.hasAnyErrors()" (/mensagem/MensagemErro:6)"

Solution: I had to change attribute from mv.addObject(new CaixaDeSom()) to mv.addObject("caixa", new CaixaDeSom())

Problem:
"Request method 'GET' not supported"

Solution: I added @RequestMapping at pesquisar method

Problem:

"Illegal attempt to map a non collection as a @OneToMany, @ManyToMany or @CollectionOfElements:"

Solution: Replace "Servico servico" for "List<Servico> servicos" because it is a 1:N relationship
